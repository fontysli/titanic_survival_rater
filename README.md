# titanic_survival_predictor
This repository provides a foundational notebook designed to introduce students to machine learning using sklearn. The case focuses on a [classification](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/getting-started-with-classification/) problem, utilizing the [Titanic dataset](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=40945&status=active) to determine the survival probability of a Titanic passenger, which is a [discrete variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable). The primary goal of this assignment is to familiarize students with classification modelling and evaluate model training outcomes by means of sklearn.

This notebook is intentionally designed as a foundational starting point and does not strictly adhere to established best practices as it is meant as a learning opportunity. This repo belongs to a five part course: 🚗 [Car price predictor](https://github.com/Fontys/car_price_predictor/)   🛳️ [Titanic Survival Rater](https://github.com/Fontys/titanic_survival_rater/)   <続く>   📧 [Sentiment Analyser](https://github.com/Fontys/sentiment_analyser/) 🚲 [Bike Rental Forecaster](https://github.com/Fontys/bike_rental_forecaster/)  
Feel free to learn from the other parts too!

## 📚 Preparation
Please ensure that you are familiar with the following aspects in order to successfully work with this repo and notebook.
 - You know the basics of [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html)
 - You know the difference between [regression and classification](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/ml-classification-vs-regression/)
 - You know the basic structure of [decision trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)
 - You understand the reasons for making [train, validate and test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training%2C_validation%2C_and_test_data_sets) datasets
 - You understand the purpose and value of classification evaluation metrics like [accuracy, precision, recall and F1-scores](https://medium.com/@ml_dl_explained/an-overview-of-classification-model-metrics-8e25432d36ea)

## 🎯 Learning opportunities
The following aspects of machine learning are part of this example:
- A brief analysis of the data
- A decision trees classifier model used for training
- Evaluating the model's performance using standardized evaluation metrics for classification problems
- A few inference to see how the model would respond.

## 🤔 Considerations for improvement
This notebook is an example on how to get started, it is open for improvements and enhancements. Feel free to clone my work and use it to study and learn. Things to consider if you want to improve this work:
- Dealing with missing values: What could be the reason for the missing values and how can the dataset be adjusted for them?
- There are more classification models than decision trees. How do other models compare to decision trees in this case?
- Calculating the R² and the RMSE of this model would help judging the model's performance. What do their values mean in relation to the case?
